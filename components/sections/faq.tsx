    q: "Can I use only one module?",
    a: "Absolutely. Start with just Training, Rental, or Event management and pay only for what you use. You can add more modules anytime as your business grows.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free trial?",
    a: "Yes - every plan starts with a 20-day free trial that includes full access to all modules. No credit card is required to get started.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I manage multiple branches?",
    a: "Yes. Multi-branch operations are built in. Manage locations, staff, and inventory across branches while owners get a consolidated view of the entire business.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you support mobile devices?",
    a: "1grow is mobile-first. Your team can manage attendance, bookings, payments, and tasks from any phone, tablet, or desktop.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: "Your data is protected with role-based access control, audit logs, encryption, and true multi-tenant isolation so each business stays completely separate.",
