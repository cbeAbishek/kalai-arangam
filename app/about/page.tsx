              <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                1grow started with a simple observation: training
                academies, rental businesses, and event companies in India still
                run on WhatsApp messages, Excel sheets, and paper registers. As
                these businesses grow, the chaos grows with them.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                We built 1grow to replace that chaos with a single,
                intelligent platform that handles everything - from student
                admissions and fee collection to inventory management and event
                planning. Our goal is simple: give business owners their time
                back so they can focus on what they do best.
